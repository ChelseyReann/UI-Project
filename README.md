# UI Project - Let's Get Cooking! ðŸ¥£

## Introduction

I worked with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a simple recipe website. I also implemented the use of Tasty's API to get all my recipe photos, descriptions, ingredients and instructions.

## How to Use

Click the link below to open the website!

The website landing page is pretty bare bones. However, once you click on the recipes located inside the hamburger menu it becomes more responsive! 

Once you click on a recipe, an image of the recipe will appear along with the ingredients needed and the instructions to follow along.
